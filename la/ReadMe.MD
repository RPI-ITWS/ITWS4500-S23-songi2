and TYPE node server.js and everything should be hosted in https://songi2.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/node

Overall, this lab was relatively easy compare to lab5. I had to use d3 react components. I created a webpage where user can click on the button to get scatter plot for average age for teams wihtin the database or you can get the average age for each position within the team.

For creativity: I made it so that the user can choose which data they want to see. Also, I have a input box where user can type in the team ID and you get to see the data about the team ID you have inputted. Also I made chartRef which will display different graphs with data based on the buttons user have clicked onto. I have used all the data from the my mongodb.
