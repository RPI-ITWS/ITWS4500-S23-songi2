Specifications:
    News ticker app that displays 5 items and transitions to another data through transitions or animations.
    Each item contains images, title, authors, descriptions, and source. For me, I just wrote hte source on the top of the page because I only used New York Times.

Creativity:
    I have used bootstrap to create flexible cards that display items about the articles. I have used bootstrap navbar to create reponsive navbar where the buttons disappear when the web is accessed through smaller mobile. I have created buttons so that whenever the user of the web wants to stop the transition they can stop immediately. They can also start the transition again with the another button. Another feature I did is clicking any component of the card will direct you to the url of that article.

        Boostrap was a big help in making responsive website. It was useful because I did not spent too much time on the css part of this lab.

        Ranging from simple questions like this to questions about data fetching was solved through this website.

        New York Times API was mainly used to make this website. This API created JSON file and I was able to use a lot of it during this lab.
        Special Thanks to Shelly. She helped me out with generating 200 articles and adding html code to objects to the output. She inspired me a lot during this lab.
    JavaScript
    HTML
    CSS
        Validation.

Process & Problems:
    I first started looking for apis to use for this project. Then I figured out that New York Times is available. But I got stuck with generating more than 15 articles with JSON format. Then classmates have helped me to find out how to fix those problems. Rest of just mainly bootstrap and javascript I did back in last semester. This lab really helped me to get back to my web coding practices. The hard part was doing the carousel transition which I originally planned, but I got stuck with not being able to call multiple cards with carousel. Ultimately, I found out that there is much easier and faster transition than carousel. I did not touch a lot of CSS mainly because of bootstrap, but I did have to change the way hyperlinks show on the website by changing css. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this lab, and looking forward to more complex language than HTML & CSS.
