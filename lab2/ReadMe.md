When I was starting this lab, I was trying to use lab 4 from last semester to start the lab. Then I realized that my lab 4 is not very good and I just started everything from the scratch. Since I have already experience with openweathermap, it really was not a problem. However, I had hard time with Leaflet openstreetmap API. I had to search different ways to do it, and ultimately I got both APIs to work. Overall, this was really fun lab because I put a lot of time into designing the lab. 

API-Football (The-Best API EVER as a Premier League Fan):

API Football is a provider of a RESTful API that allows developers to access live soccer data, including information on teams, players, matches, and more. The API uses standard HTTP requests and returns data in JSON format. The API provides several endpoints that developers can use to retrieve specific data, such as live scores, match statistics, and team information. Developers can also use the API to get historical data, such as past results, and also to get information about leagues and teams. The API is often used to create soccer-related apps and websites, such as live score updates, statistics, and team information. One advantage of this API is that it is very detailed. It records everything from players who have scored to data showing which players did certain amount of errors. This organization did very well of gathering all this data, and what is suprising is that they include data from most leagues. Here is an example of request. get("https://v3.football.api-sports.io/status");


Google Search API:

The Google Search API is one of the API that I studied. It allows developers to access the capabilities of Google Search in a programmatic way, by sending a search query and receiving a list of relevant results in return. The API utilizes a RESTful architecture, which means it can be accessed using standard HTTP requests. There are two types of searches that can be performed using the API: web search and image search. Web search returns a list of relevant web pages, with information such as the title, description, and URL included in the JSON formatted results. Image search returns a list of relevant images, with information like the image's URL, size, and format included in the results. One of the most impressive aspects of the API is that it can be used for free, as long as usage limits are not exceeded. The data is well-organized and easily accessible, making it popular among developers. Additionally, the API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the search results.

Deezer API:

Another API I studeid was Deezer API. Deezer API is an API that allows users to access the service of the Deezer music streaming service programmatically. The API can be used to retrieve information about music tracks, albums, artists, playlists, and more. The API also enables developers to access user-related data, such as playlists, favorites, and listening history. This API is similar to Google Search API in ways how it uses RESTful architecture and use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. I am starting to realize that these are the features that are used by popular APIs. One thing I would like to add for API is the addition of links to the all the song within the album. It may take up a large amount of data but it will be really useful. Another interesting part of this API is that it can be used to directly stream song from the API.
