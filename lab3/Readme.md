So once someone logs in to https://songi2.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/node is the landing page for my website. I did this on purpose because I assume that later on we will learn more about MongoDB and I wanted create website so that I can use that in the future. The main focus of this lab was on the Match History Page. If you click on Match History you will get to the main product I worked on for this lab3. If you clikc on clikc to get match data button, the frontend will send node to search api and I have created json file in https://songi2.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/node/match which the node will grab the data from and give it to the frontend. You can see that my website is fully functioning with the external api and my own api I created.

I originally used SportsData which was free api but for some reason, it's server got shutdown. So I had to change my lab API. This lab was difficult than I thought mostly because I had to run node server to display my website. I had a lot of trouble installing npm within my folder but with the help from Ryan, I realized that I just needed to make more space available for the folder. Another part that was difficult was about displaying the picture and locating those images. I got this help from Wendy(?), she helped me to locate the pictures. However, I am pretty sure that there is an easier way of using : to get the data I need. I can just pass in the parameter. I'll make sure to look into for upcoming labs. 

For creativity, I have spent a lot of time on building the frontend side with animations. I got to know how to use AOS which is super cool animation technique. I also used bootstrap within my website to add creativity as well as mobile friendly website.

Overall, this lab was not very easy but it was worth it. I got to know how node and express function and I really learned a lot of things from this lab.
