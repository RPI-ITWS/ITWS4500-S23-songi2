I was looking through my website and thinking what was missing for my website. My original plan of this website was to create a soccer site where users can see the stats of players and match history with betting oddes to predict which team will win the game. That is why I found a another API which will give back betting odds for games that are taking place today.
For creativity, I searched the web to find an API that will give back the betting odds of the game that is taking place within 12 hours. I was decorated the site with html and css. 
Overall, my website becamse successful with multiple APIs and player data to give enough information to the users to get their prediction correct for soccer games.
